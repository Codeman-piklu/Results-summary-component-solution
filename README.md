## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 for semantic markup.
- CSS3 for styling and layout, using variables, Flexbox, and Grid.
- Google Fonts for typography (Hanken Grotesk)

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of:

## CSS Variables for managing colors and styles efficiently:

:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --light-blue: hsl(221, 100%, 96%);
  --dark-gray-blue: hsl(224, 30%, 27%);
}
## Flexbox and Grid for layout and alignment:
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
## Responsive design techniques to ensure usability across different devices.


### Continued development
- In future projects, I aim to:

- Implement advanced animations and transitions for a smoother user experience.

- Focus more on accessibility features like ARIA labels and better keyboard navigation.

- Explore using CSS frameworks to speed up the styling process.
### Useful resources

- CSS Tricks - A great resource for learning new CSS techniques.

- MDN Web Docs - Comprehensive documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
